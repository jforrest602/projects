## Day 11: Understanding Brute Force Attacks
The goals for today are threefold:
* Understand what a brute force attack is.
* Learn about common tools used to perform the attack.
* Learn how to protect yourself from a brute force attack.

#### What is a brute force attack?
A brute force attack is a method used to gain unauthorized access to a system, account, or encrypted data by systematically trying all possible combinations of passwords, encryption keys, or credentials until the correct one is found. This attack method relies on computing power and persistence rather than exploiting vulnerabilities.

Unfortunately, brute force methods are accessible and easy to use, making it a common attack method. Servers all around the world have services running that are exposed to the internet, like remote desktop (RDP), allowing anyone from the internet to connect and attempt to login using credentials found in password dumps, malware, or social engineering techniques.
