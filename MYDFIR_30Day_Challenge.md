# MyDFIR 30 Day SOC Analyst Challenge


This 30-day Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst challenge aims to provide free, practical experience for aspiring SOC analysts who may lack hands-on experience. It is designed to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application of skills for entry level applicants. 

The challenge consists of daily lessons released on YouTube and will cover topics  such as creating logical diagrams, the ELK stack, attacking machines, detecting and investigating those attacks. Practical skills include creating alerts and dashboards, as well as integrating a ticketing system to track work flow.
