# Active Directory Basics 

According to [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts/active-directory-domain-services-overview?source=recommendations), Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) "provides the methods for storing directory data and making this data available to network users and administrators." They define a directory as "a hierarchical structure that stores information about objects on the network." Objects are single elements like users, groups,shared folders, computers, printers and so on. AD stores object details and enables authorized users to access that information.

This introductory AD lab was completed in the HTB [Introduction to Active Directory](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/74) module which covers AD basics. The goal of this lab was to gain confidence performing basic AD administrative tasks through the Windows graphical user interface (GUI).
