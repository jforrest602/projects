## Day 21: Mythic Agent Steup
Today's task will demonstrate how to perform a brute force attack, generate a Mythic agent, and establish a Command-and-Control session from a Windows server. This attack follows the attack diagram created on Day 19. However, there are a few things to prepare before initiating the attack. 

First, I created a fake `passwords.txt` file located on my Windows server. Within this text file is the password honeypot2024!.

Next, I want change the password to this Windows server to honeypot2024! To do this, navigate to `Start menu > User name > Change account settings > Sign-in options > Password > Change`.

After entering the current password and new password, I found that this new password, honeypot2024!, did not meet the password policy requirements. Not a problem. I just needed to edit the group policy by changing the minimum password length and disable the requirement to meet password complexity. To do this, navigate to `Edit group policy` by typing `group policy` in the search bar.
